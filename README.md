# Electra: Predicate-Aware Approximate Query Processing
This repository contains the details to generate the query workloads and datasets used to evaluate Electra: Predicate-Aware Approximate Query Processing.

### Datasets
- Electra was evaluated on three different datasets - `Flights`, `Housing` and `Beijing PM2.5`.
- Each of the sub-folders give details of the original dataset, pre-processing done and workloads generated on them.

### Relative Error Plots
- In order to have a better visualization, we use the bounded `sMAPE` measure - which is bound between 0 and 2.
- For the sake of completeness, we have included the relative error plots in `relative-error-plots/` directory.
